12M4. Fit the following cross-classified multilevel model to the chimpanzees data:
$$
Li \sim Binomial(1, p_i)\\
logit(p_i) = \alpha_{actor[i]} + \alpha_{block[i]} + (\beta_P + \beta_{PC}Ci)Pi\\
\alpha_{actor} \sim Normal(\alpha, \sigma_{actor})\\
\alpha_{block} \sim Normal(\gamma, \sigma_{block})\\
\alpha, \gamma, \beta_p, \beta_{PC} \sim Normal(0, 10)\\
\sigma_{actor}, \sigma_{}
\sigma_{actor}; \sigma_{block} \sim HalfCauchy(0, 1)
$$


Each of the parameters in those comma-separated lists gets the same independent prior. Compare
the posterior distribution to that produced by the similar cross-classified model from the chapter.
Also compare the number of effective samples. Can you explain the differences?
